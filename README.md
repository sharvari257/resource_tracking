# Resource Tracking System

## DESCRIPTION
This project is a small-scale system monitoring tool that tracks CPU usage using
Python’s psutil library, stores it in a MySQL database, and visualizes it on a real-time dashboard built using Dash and Plotly. It helps us understand how to combine backend data collection, storage, and frontend visualization — all in Python.

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
resource_tracking/
  cpu_usage_alert.py
  dash_app.py
  graph_data.py
  temp-plot.html
  testing.py
  __pycache__/
  email.cpython-312.pyc

## OVERVIEW
Language    Python
DB          MySQL
Libs        psutil, mysql.connector, dash, plotly, pandas, smtplib, email
Dashboard   Dash (a python web framework for interactive dashboards)

## FEATURES
- 📊 **Real-time CPU usage tracking**
- ⚠️ **Automatic alerting** when CPU crosses a threshold
- 📈 **Interactive dashboard** built with Dash (Plotly)
- 🧠 **Background tasks** to log and process system data
- 🧩 **Modular code structure** — easy to extend and learn from

## INSTALLATION and SETUP
bash
git clone https://github.com/sharvari257/resource-tracking-system.git
cd resource_tracking

create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # (Mac/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate         # (Windows)

To install the required libraries, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## HOW IT WORKS
1. cpu_usage_alert.py continuously checks CPU metrics.
2. When a threshold is crossed, it triggers a warning or logs the event.
3. graph_data.py formats collected data for display.
4. dash_app.py renders a dashboard (via Dash/Plotly) that updates in real-time.
5. Background scripts (task.py, task2.py) handle logging or periodic updates.

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT
CPU Usage Alert Example:
```Warning! CPU usage exceeded 85% at 12:45:20```

Dashboard Example:
* Displays CPU usage graph updating in real-time
* Highlights alert regions or spikes visually
